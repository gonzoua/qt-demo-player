// Macro which connects a signal to a slot, and which causes application to
// abort if the connection fails.  This is intended to catch programming errors
// such as mis-typing a signal or slot name.  It is necessary to write our own
// macro to do this - the following idiom
//     Q_ASSERT(connect(source, signal, receiver, slot));
// will not work because Q_ASSERT compiles to a no-op in release builds.
